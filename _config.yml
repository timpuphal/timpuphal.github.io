# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a researcher in motion planning for mobile robots. I am an associate at Honda Research Institute [Japan](https://www.jp.honda-ri.com/en/) and [Europe](https://www.honda-ri.de/) 
  where we are pushing the intelligence and cooperative interaction of robots in human environments.
  I received my Ph.D from the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) in 2021 where I was advised by
  [Julian Eggert](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=pwrMce4AAAAJ&hl=ja) and
  [JÃ¼rgen Adamy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cP84NS8AAAAJ&hl=en).

  My current research interests are primarily in robust planning, cooperative planning and human-robot interaction.
